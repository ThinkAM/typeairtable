TypeAirtable is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features
that help you to develop any kind of application that uses airtable database - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple airtable databases.

TypeAirtable is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

## Features

- Works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms / ReactJS / Angular / VueJS.
- TypeScript and JavaScript support.
- ESM and CommonJS support.
- Produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable.

And more...

With TypeAirtable your find look like this:

```typescript
import { AirTableConfig } from '@thinkam/typeairtable';

const config = new AirTableConfig();

const instance = config.configure({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.airtable.com/v0/your_url',
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
});

const repository = instance.getRepository({
  tableName: 'your_table',
  columns: {
    name: 'singleText',
    isActived: 'checkBox',
  },
});

const result = await repository.find({
  select: ['name'],
  where: { name: 'blah' },
});
```

And your create looks like this:

```typescript
await repository.create({
  name: 'your_name',
  isActived: true,
});
```

If you prefer update, you can use it as well:

```typescript
await repository.update('your_id', {
  name: 'other_name',
  isActived: false,
});
```

And your delete will look this way:

```typescript
await repository.destroy('your_id');
```
